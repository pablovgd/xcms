abstract = {Many research questions in fields such as personalized medicine, drug screens or systems biology depend on obtaining consistent and quantitatively accurate proteomics data from many samples. SWATH-MS is a specific variant of data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods and is emerging as a technology that combines deep proteome coverage capabilities with quantitative consistency and accuracy. In a SWATH-MS measurement, all ionized peptides of a given sample that fall within a specified mass range are fragmented in a systematic and unbiased fashion using rather large precursor isolation windows. To analyse SWATH-MS data, a strategy based on peptide-centric scoring has been established, which typically requires prior knowledge about the chromatographic and mass spectrometric behaviour of peptides of interest in the form of spectral libraries and peptide query parameters. This tutorial provides guidelines on how to set up and plan a SWATH-MS experiment, how to perform the mass spectrometric measurement and how to analyse SWATH-MS data using peptide-centric scoring. Furthermore, concepts on how to improve SWATH-MS data acquisition, potential trade-offs of parameter settings and alternative data analysis strategies are discussed.},

@article{Kumler2023,
  title     = "Picky with peakpicking: assessing chromatographic peak quality
               with simple metrics in metabolomics",
  author    = "Kumler, William and Hazelton, Bryna J and Ingalls, Anitra E",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Chromatographic peakpicking continues to represent a
               significant bottleneck in automated LC-MS workflows.
               Uncontrolled false discovery rates and the lack of
               manually-calibrated quality metrics require researchers to
               visually evaluate individual peaks, requiring large amounts of
               time and breaking replicability. This problem is exacerbated in
               noisy environmental datasets and for novel separation methods
               such as hydrophilic interaction columns in metabolomics,
               creating a demand for a simple, intuitive, and robust metric of
               peak quality. RESULTS: Here, we manually labeled four HILIC
               oceanographic particulate metabolite datasets to assess the
               performance of individual peak quality metrics. We used these
               datasets to construct a predictive model calibrated to the
               likelihood that visual inspection by an MS expert would include
               a given mass feature in the downstream analysis. We implemented
               two novel peak quality metrics, a custom signal-to-noise metric
               and a test of similarity to a bell curve, both calculated from
               the raw data in the extracted ion chromatogram, and found that
               these outperformed existing measurements of peak quality. A
               simple logistic regression model built on two metrics reduced
               the fraction of false positives in the analysis from 70-80\%
               down to 1-5\% and showed minimal overfitting when applied to
               novel datasets. We then explored the implications of this
               quality thresholding on the conclusions obtained by the
               downstream analysis and found that while only 10\% of the
               variance in the dataset could be explained by depth in the
               default output from the peakpicker, approximately 40\% of the
               variance was explained when restricted to high-quality peaks
               alone. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the poor performance of
               peakpicking algorithms significantly reduces the power of both
               univariate and multivariate statistical analyses to detect
               environmental differences. We demonstrate that simple models
               built on intuitive metrics and derived from the raw data are
               more robust and can outperform more complex models when applied
               to new data. Finally, we show that in properly curated datasets,
               depth is a major driver of variability in the marine microbial
               metabolome and identify several interesting metabolite trends
               for future investigation.",
